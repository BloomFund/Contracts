BloomFund


Welcome to our groundbreaking community-driven BloomFund a visionary project poised to revolutionize
investing. Our mission is to establish an innovative investment fund that transcends traditional 
barriers, starting as an inclusive vehicle for growth and maturing into a robust hedge crypto fund.
What sets us apart is the opportunity for active participation: by holding our 
project's token, individuals become integral stakeholders, directly impacting and reflecting 
the project's evolution through the token's price. Our goal is to create a symbiotic 
relationship between the project's growth and the community's involvement, 
forging a new era of investment where everyone contributes to and benefits from the fund's success. 

Applying the proven most effective DCA* strategy, we buy some of the major cryptocurrencies, which we store using the Staking** method.
With DCA, we acquire positions in low-risk investments.
We create our own Token, named BLO, of ERC-20 type, using the efficiency and security of the Ethereum Network. In this way, we provide users with a secure and isolated environment for transactions involving our Token.
Utility of the Token: BLO operates as the central Utility Token of the BloomFund ecosystem, offering holders some advantages such as:
    • Rewards for participating in Staking
    • Participation in votes for significant decisions

Tokenomics: The total number of BLO to be issued is limited to 300,000,000 with a distribution plan as follows:
    • 5% in Presale
    • 20% in the Project's treasury
    • 20% to the Project's team with Vesting***
    • 20% to the community through Staking, Airdrops, and partnerships
    • 15% for Marketing
    • 20% for creation and development, funding the Technical Roadmap

Our treasury will consist of:
    • 60% from the Top 10 cryptocurrencies
    • 20% from our Token
    • 20% from a low-risk Portfolio
Profits from the low-risk Portfolio will be used for:
    • 20% purchasing our Token from the open market and "burning" it, removing it permanently from circulation
    • 30% returning to the Portfolio in the form of BTC, BNB, ETH
    • 50% used to increase capital in the low-risk Portfolio
A 0.1% tax will be applied to transactions involving our Token, where: This 0.1% will be burned.
The growth of our Portfolio automatically contributes to the growth of our Token, giving back to the community what it sought from the beginning - a secure and evolving coin.
Roadmap

Explanations:
*DCA: Known as Dollar Cost Average, a strategy of investment over time. This method helps to reduce the impact of price fluctuations and potentially lowers the average investment cost. Thus, it provides a stable and less stressful way to enter the market.
**Staking: In the crypto environment, it involves locking special Tokens to support the digital system, earning additional Tokens as a reward.
***Vesting: A mechanism that ensures team members stay committed to the Project and don't sell their Tokens immediately after creation, as these are gradually offered to them.
